### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Django and Wagtail client projects. I'm exploring different ways to use Wagtail CMS to power real world business applications.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to better streamline client work, and specialize in the Django stack.

âš¡ Fun facts: I'm Canadian, a licensed pilot, ex-military officer, terrible chess player, all of my editors are Dracula themed and I'm a coffee enthousiast.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: hello@glennpaquette.com

ðŸ’¬ I'm open to chat about collaborations, Django, and ... anything really.
